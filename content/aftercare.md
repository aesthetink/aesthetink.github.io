### Aftercare - the most <strong>important </strong> part of your new tattoo
Keep your tattoo bandaged with cling film for around 1 hour. After this time you can remove it and wash your tattoo gently with warm, soapy water. 

Rinse thoroughly with cold water to close the pores and lightly pat dry with clean paper towel. With clean hands, apply a THIN layer of aftercare cream roughly every 2 - 3 hours. You can do this as many times throughout the day as you need to depending on the dryness of your skin.

You should wash your tattoo twice day repeating the above process. Continue this process for around 2 to 3 weeks.

- DO NOT re-bandage your tattoo with cling film.

- DO NOT use vaseline or petroleum jelly 

- DO NOT use alcohol or peroxide 

- DO NOT pick or scratch your tattoo 

- DO NOT soak your tattoo in the bath or shower- get in, get clean, getout!

Stay out of pools, hot tubs, oceans, etc. for two weeks. Keep your tattoo out of direct sunlight/tanning beds.
